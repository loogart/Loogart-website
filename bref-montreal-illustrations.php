                    <h1>Encore Montréal Illustrations by Loogart</h1>
                    <p>Bref is a Montreal-based boutique, gallery and event venue who’s mission is to offer art and design lovers a unique shopping experience. Every month, they bring together, under a unified theme, exclusive articles created by local and international emerging artists and brands.</p>

                    <h3>Bref x Loogart</h3>
                    <p>Loogart was approached to be a part of the awesome “Bref, vivez Montréal!” theme, which complemented the 375th anniversary of Montreal. The partnership between Loogart and Bref was such an inspiring one. We created 8 new illustrations which would represent specific neighbourhoods in Montreal: Montreal Island, Little Italy, Mile-End, Le Plateau, Saint-Henri, Griffintown, Le Village and Hochelaga-Maisonneuve.</p>
                    <div class="row">
                        <div class="col-sm-6">
                            <img class="img-responsive img-spacing" src="./img/portfolio/bref/" data-action="zoom">
                        </div>
                        <div class="col-sm-6">
                            <img class="img-responsive img-spacing" src="./img/portfolio/bref/" data-action="zoom">
                        </div>
                    </div>

                    <p>The illustrations were designed to fit a square which constrains the design area, thus requiring artistic simplification of the elements and landmarks within each one. Style consistency was implemented by building a limited colour palette and by style i.e. thick bold lines married with circular anchors - reminiscent of the original Montreal CityLine collection.</p>

                    <p>Limited edition products were made through the Bref x Loogart collaboration which you buy directly at the gallery or via their only shop. These products include prints, t-shirts, stamps, drinkware and postcards.</p>
